In Time is a time-traveling puzzle platformer in which the main character improves a time machine that is initially only able to travel back one day until he can go back far enough to save the world.

Not all stages were implemented.  What we have finished is around 30% of the story and stages planned.  The game cuts off when the last implemented stage is completed by the player.

Stages:

* Museum (2 of 3)
* Power Plant (1 of 2)
* Subway/Underground*
* Research Company*
* ??? (secret)*

\* - unimplemented

Art assets have not been fully integrated.  A few backgrounds and models have been put in, but it is largely proxy geometry.

#Implemented Features
Basic RPG-style game base, including features such as:
* Dialogue
* Cutscenes
* Events
* Unlockables
* Inventory
* Quests
* NPCs
Three sample platforming stages, including puzzle elements:
* Switches
* Doors
* Security Guards
* Security Cameras
* Blocks
* Time Bubbles
* Moving Platforms
Limited art assets, including:
* A number of background images
* A time machine (model + texture)
* Rigged model of main character (somewhat broken)
* Base mesh of the professor character

All code was developed from scratch, no plugins were used.  There may be some textures from a metal textures pack in the game.
