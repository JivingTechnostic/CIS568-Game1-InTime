In Time is a time-traveling puzzle platformer in which the main character improves a time machine that is initially only able to travel back one day until he can go back far enough to save the world.

Not all stages were implemented.  What we have finished is around 30% of the story and stages planned.  The game cuts off when the last implemented stage is completed by the player.

Stages:

* Museum (2 of 3)
* Power Plant (1 of 2)
* Subway/Underground*
* Research Company*
* ??? (secret)*

\* - unimplemented

Art assets have not been fully integrated.  A few backgrounds and models have been put in, but it is largely proxy geometry.
